        <h3>Every year, millions of tons of plastic enter the oceans, of which the majority spills out from rivers.<br> A portion of this plastic travels to ocean garbage patches, getting caught in a vortex of circulating currents.<br> If no action is taken, the plastic will increasingly impact our ecosystems, health, and economies.</h3>

        <h3>The Ocean Cleanup is a non-profit organization developing and scaling technologies to rid the oceans of plastic. <br>To achieve this objective, we have to work on a combination of closing the source and cleaning up what has already <br>accumulated in the ocean and doesn’t go away by itself. This goal means we plan to put ourselves out of business – <br>once we have completed this project, our work is done.</h3>
